Hi :wave:, I'm TomÃ¡s, a **theoretical physicist** currently working on high-energy physics (hep-th) while at the same time transitioning into the field of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. Among (many) other interests, I am particularly fascinated by the application of artificial intelligence for **clinical or medical purposes**.

I'm currently doing a **PhD** in hep-th at Humboldt University in Berlin :de:, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Olaf Hohm](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1041905?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true). My research focus is on higher-derivative corrections in **string theory**, a candidate theory to describe gravity at a quantum regime, particularly restricted to cosmological and black-hole backgrounds. Check out my scientific papers [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1809351?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true) if you want to learn more about my research! Before the PhD I completed a "Licenciatura" in physics (equivalent to a bachelor plus master's degree) at "Universidad de Buenos Aires", **Argentina** ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·. 

While beautiful and exciting in many different ways, hep-th can sometimes get too abstract, and even lose contact with the real world because of the lack of empirical evidence to contrast with the theory. These features made me look for another subject within science and technology where I could **make a positive impact on people**, while, at the same time, still solving intellectually challenging problems. My love for coding and curiosity about how the brain works brought me to **NeuroAI** ðŸ§ . From October 2022 to April 2023 I did an internship at the "Computational Neuroscience and Data Assimilation" group at the Technical University of Berlin on modeling and simulation of neural population dynamics, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Tilo Schwalger](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=exZ1seUAAAAJ&hl=de). Apart from theoretical aspects, I was involved in **neural data analysis** and statistical inference tasks for Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and multi-unit neuronal recordings.
