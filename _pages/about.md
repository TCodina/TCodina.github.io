Hi :wave:, I'm TomÃ¡s, a **theoretical physicist** transitioning into the field of **data science** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. Among (many) other interests, I am particularly enthusiastic about applying machine learning to **biomedicine** and **healthcare**.

I did a **PhD** in theoretical high-energy physics (hep-th) at Humboldt University in Berlin :de:, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Olaf Hohm](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1041905?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true). My research focused on higher-derivative corrections in **string theory**, a candidate theory to describe gravity at a quantum regime, particularly restricted to cosmological and black-hole backgrounds. Check out my scientific papers [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1809351?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true) if you want to learn more about my research! Before the PhD I completed a "Licenciatura" in physics (equivalent to a bachelor plus master's degree) at "Universidad de Buenos Aires", **Argentina** ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·. 

While elegant and captivating, hep-th can sometimes get too abstract, and even lose contact with the real world because of the lack of empirical evidence to contrast with the theory. These features made me look for another field, and my love for coding and curiosity about how the brain works brought me to **NeuroAI** ðŸ§ . For six months I did an internship at the "Computational Neuroscience and Data Assimilation" group at the Technical University of Berlin on modeling and simulation of neural population dynamics, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Tilo Schwalger](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=exZ1seUAAAAJ&hl=de). Apart from theoretical aspects, I was involved in **neural data analysis** and **statistical inference tasks** for Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and multi-unit neuronal recordings.

From that experience, I gained a deep interest in **data science** in connection with **AI**, and **IT**, and I am currently in search of exciting projects where I can combine these subjects to **make a positive impact on people**.
