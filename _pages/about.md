Hi :wave:, I'm TomÃ¡s, a theoretical physicist currently working on high-energy physics (hep-th) while at the same time transitioning into the field of NeuroAI ðŸ§ , as the intersection between computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Among (many) other interests, I am particularly fascinated by neural data science, neural dynamics, bio-inspired artificial intelligence, and the application of machine learning techniques to clinical neuroscience.

I'm currently doing a PhD in hep-th at Humboldt University in Berlin :de:, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Olaf Hohm](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1041905?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true). My research focus is on string theory, a candidate theory to describe gravity at a quantum regime, particularly restricted to cosmological and black-hole backgrounds. Check out my scientific papers [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1809351?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true) if you want to learn more about my research! Before the PhD I completed a "Licenciatura" in physics (equivalent to a bachelor plus master's degree) at "Universidad de Buenos Aires", Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·. 

While beautiful and exciting in many different ways, hep-th can sometimes get too abstract, and even lose contact with the real world because of the lack of empirical evidence to contrast with the theory. These features made me look for another subject within science and technology where I could make a positive impact on people, while, at the same time, still solving intellectually challenging problems. My love for coding and curiosity about how the brain works brought me to NeuroAI. As my first step in this thrilling field, since September 2022 I am working on modeling and simulation of neural population dynamics in collaboration with [Prof. Dr.
Tilo Schwalger](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=exZ1seUAAAAJ&hl=de), [Prof. Dr. Tatiana Engel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vq0BIO4AAAAJ&hl=en) and Nils Greven. Apart from the theoretical aspects, I am also involved in the neural data analysis and statistical inference tasks, where I analyze LFP and multi-unit neuronal recordings, and estimate model features from data.
